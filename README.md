Transmission
================

Transmission is meant as an application to facilitate the transfer of data from a source to a normalized CSV-file.
The CSV-files can be further manipulated to get an input for another application.

Transmission's purpose is to make it possible for a maintainer to configure via this app the sources without an account on the server. 

This is a work in progress. Still to come, is further documentation and the configuring of the actual retrieval of the data.
In the future the seeding of the database will be further enhanced to describe more classes. The testing of the connection to the sources also have to be implemented.
